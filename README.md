  - More broadly, Andreas Borgen is a good one to keep an eye on - https://github.com/Sphinxxxx & https://codepen.io/Sphinxxxx/pens/
- Perhaps I could draw curves with beziers, see https://github.com/soswow/fit-curve
  - not sure the added complexity of sub-division algorithms, though
- I think I need to review the underlying data structure. I did it to comply more easily to the DOM, but having all slices with x: 0, y:0 and no bounding box is veeeery confusing
- flatten-js can be a good way to guide the data remodeling and to do things more easily - I'm not understanding the math from the from-scratch code, anyways
